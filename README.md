## 🛠️ Technical Highlights

### **AI/ML Capabilities**
```python
# MCP AI Assistant with self-correcting queries
response = await apiClient.llmOrchestrate({
    query: "Show me the top mismatches from the latest reconciliation",
    self_correct: true,
    include_summary: true,
    max_retries: 2
})
```

### **High-Performance Reconciliation**
```python
# Async processing with Redis caching
async def run_reconciliation(batch_id: int):
    # Process 1000+ records in <5 seconds
    # Real-time progress updates
    # AI-powered risk assessment
```

### **Enterprise Security**
```python
# Multi-tenant RBAC with audit trails
@require_tenant_access
async def get_payroll_data(tenant_id: str):
    # Isolated data access
    # Comprehensive audit logging
    # Role-based permissions
```

### **Cloud-Native Infrastructure**
```bicep
// Azure Bicep templates for production deployment
resource webApp 'Microsoft.Web/sites@2022-03-01' = {
  name: 'payfast-${environment}'
  location: location
  properties: {
    // Production-ready configuration
  }
}
```

## 🤖 MCP AI Assistant

The platform includes an intelligent **Model Context Protocol (MCP) AI Assistant** that provides:

### **Natural Language Queries**
- Ask questions about payroll data in plain English
- Get instant insights about reconciliation results
- Explore patterns and trends in your data

### **Intelligent Data Analysis**
- **SQL Query Generation** - Automatically converts questions to database queries
- **Self-Correcting Logic** - Retries and refines queries for better results
- **Comprehensive Summaries** - Provides detailed explanations of findings
- **Data Visualization** - Shows results in organized, interactive tables

### **Real-Time Processing**
- **Live Data Access** - Queries current payroll and reconciliation data
- **Fast Response Times** - Results in under 3 seconds for complex queries
- **Error Handling** - Graceful fallbacks and helpful error messages

### **Example Interactions**
```
User: "Show me the top mismatches from the latest reconciliation"
AI: "Found 539 reconciliation issues. Main types: missing_coverage (employees charged without enrollment) and mismatch_pct (contribution percentage discrepancies)."

User: "What were the main causes of reconciliation failures?"
AI: "Analysis shows 78% missing_coverage issues (no active enrollment) and 22% mismatch_pct (incorrect contribution percentages)."
```
