## 🛠️ Technical Highlights

### **AI/ML Capabilities**
```python
# LLM Orchestration with self-correcting queries
response = await apiClient.llmOrchestrate({
    query: "Show me the top mismatches from the latest reconciliation",
    self_correct: true,
    include_summary: true,
    max_retries: 2
})
```

### **High-Performance Reconciliation**
```python
# Async processing with Redis caching
async def run_reconciliation(batch_id: int):
    # Process 1000+ records in <5 seconds
    # Real-time progress updates
    # AI-powered risk assessment
```

### **Enterprise Security**
```python
# Multi-tenant RBAC with audit trails
@require_tenant_access
async def get_payroll_data(tenant_id: str):
    # Isolated data access
    # Comprehensive audit logging
    # Role-based permissions
```

### **Cloud-Native Infrastructure**
```bicep
// Azure Bicep templates for production deployment
resource webApp 'Microsoft.Web/sites@2022-03-01' = {
  name: 'payfast-${environment}'
  location: location
  properties: {
    // Production-ready configuration
  }
}
```
